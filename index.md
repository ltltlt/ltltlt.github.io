## A poem a day, keeps foolish away.
> For whom the bell tolls   
> No man is an island,   
Entire of itself.   
Each is a piece of the continent,   
A part of the main.   
If a clod be washed away by the sea,   
Motherland is the less.   
As well as if a promontory were.   
As well as if a manner of thine own   
Or of thine friend's were.   
Each man's death diminishes me,   
For I am involved in mankind.   
Therefore, send not to know   
For whom the bell tolls,   
It tolls for thee.
